Generated by phase-orchestrator from planning/PLAN.md

- [ ] Phase 01: {Name} - {Goal}
- [ ] Phase 02: {Name} - {Goal}
- [ ] Phase 03: {Name} - {Goal}

Line format is strict: `- [ ] Phase <number>: <Name> - <Goal>`
Number format supports: `01`, `02`, `03`, and inserted decimals like `02.1`.
If a name or goal is missing, use placeholders (`TBD Phase 01` / `Goal TBD`).
